# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for the 2024 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) competition by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz), mostly written in R. My solutions require the following support packages:

```R
library(tictoc) # timing tests
library(dplyr) # data frame munging
library(igraph) # graph tools
library(viridis) # colors and visualization
library(parallel) # parallel processing
library(gtools) # for permutations and combinations
library(stringr) # str_count
library(numbers) # for LCM function
```

Note: Wastl has asked people [not to publish the puzzle inputs](https://mobile.twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081), so I have removed them from this public repo (more [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zh2hk0/2022friendly_reminder_dont_commit_your_input/)).
